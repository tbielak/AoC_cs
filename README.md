| [bin/input](bin/input) | My input of all puzzles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [bin](bin)             | Initially empty, but here you'll find executables after successful build in *Release* configuration. You can executables directly from this location, as they read puzzle input from *input* directory by default. Look inside to learn how to run the solutions from command line. |
| [sources](sources)     | Source files. Review and enjoy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
